Hi, i'm Willmar Knikker currently working @ Topicus healthcare nice to meet you!
This is my work related github account, for personal projects just ask me on slack
and I would be happy to nerd out about my intrests and personal projects.

On another note: 
Brought a strawberry plant to the office, if it survives to the point it starts making
strawberries I will share them at the office.

Update on the strawberry plant:
Sadly the strawberry plant at the office got a little bit less water duing
the pandamic and died. It did give me a great idea for a auto watering pot.
